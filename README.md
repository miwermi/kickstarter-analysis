# Module 1 Exercise: An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 

Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends for hypothetical analysis project for Louise, a playwrite who wants to do a kickstarter campaign to fund her play, "FEVER"

We looked at global kickstarter data and narrowed it to comparative campaigns (i.e. theatrical works, plays, and musicals) in the US  - and Britian where some of Louise's favorites have been successfully funded.

Louise's budget was $10K but that is more funding than most have been able to acquire.  Analysis indicates she should keep her kickstarter at a lower goal. 

Also, it appears the best month to launch would be May.
